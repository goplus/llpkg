/**
 * @brief Calculate the minimal memory required for compression with the given block size.
 * This includes all internal buffers and state structures. This calculates the amount of bytes
 * that will be allocated by a call to `bz3_new()`.
 *
 * @details Memory allocation and usage patterns:
 *
 * bz3_new():
 *    - Allocates all memory upfront:
 *      - Core state structure (sizeof(struct bz3_state))
 *      - Swap buffer (bz3_bound(block_size) bytes)
 *      - SAIS array (BWT_BOUND(block_size) * sizeof(int32_t) bytes)
 *      - LZP lookup table ((1 << LZP_DICTIONARY) * sizeof(int32_t) bytes)
 *      - Compression state (sizeof(state))
 *    - All memory remains allocated until bz3_free()
 *
 * Additional memory may be used depending on API used from here.
 *
 * # Low Level APIs
 *
 * 1. bz3_encode_block() / bz3_decode_block():
 *    - Uses pre-allocated memory from bz3_new()
 *    - No additional memory allocation except for libsais (usually ~16KiB)
 *    - Peak memory usage of physical RAM varies with compression stages:
 *      - LZP: Uses LZP lookup table + swap buffer
 *      - BWT: Uses SAIS array + swap buffer
 *      - Entropy coding: Uses compression state (cm_state) + swap buffer
 *
 * Using the higher level API, `bz3_compress`, expect an additional allocation
 * of `bz3_bound(block_size)`.
 *
 * In the parallel version `bz3_encode_blocks`, each thread gets its own state,
 * so memory usage is `n_threads * bz3_compress_memory_needed()`.
 *
 * # High Level APIs
 *
 * 1. bz3_compress():
 *    - Allocates additional temporary compression buffer (bz3_bound(block_size) bytes)
 *      in addition to the memory amount returned by this method call and libsais.
 *    - Everything is freed after compression completes
 *
 * 2. bz3_decompress():
 *    - Allocates additional temporary compression buffer (bz3_bound(block_size) bytes)
 *      in addition to the memory amount returned by this method call and libsais.
 *    - Everything is freed after compression completes
 *
 * Memory remains constant during operation, with except of some small allocations from libsais during
 * BWT stage. That is not accounted by this function, though it usually amounts to ~16KiB, negligible.
 * The worst case of BWT is 2*block_size technically speaking.
 *
 * No dynamic (re)allocation occurs outside of that.
 *
 * @param block_size The block size to be used for compression
 * @return The total number of bytes required for compression, or 0 if block_size is invalid

 * @remarks
 *
 *      This function is useful for external APIs using the low level block encoding API,
 *      `bz3_encode_block`. You would normally call this directly after `bz3_encode_block`
 *      on the block that has been output.
 *
 *      The purpose of this function is to prevent encoding blocks that would require an additional
 *      malloc at decompress time.
 *      The goal is to prevent erroring with `BZ3_ERR_DATA_SIZE_TOO_SMALL`, thus
 *      in turn
